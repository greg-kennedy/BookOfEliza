Lord, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee
Lord, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments
Lord, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place where thine honour dwelleth
Lord, be thou my helper
Lord, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong
Lord, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked triumph?
Lord, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is
Lord, thou hast heard the desire of the humble
Lord, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Lord, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face from me?
a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise
a brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this
a father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God in his holy habitation
a fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about
a fire shall devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him
a froward heart shall depart from me
a fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein
a good man sheweth favour, and lendeth
a good understanding have all they that do his commandments
a little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches of many wicked
a man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the thick trees
a mighty man is not delivered by much strength
a people whom I have not known shall serve me
a seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation
a thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee
accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O Lord, and teach me thy judgments
according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, O Lord
according to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends of the earth
according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions
add iniquity unto their iniquity
again, they are minished and brought low through oppression, affliction, and sorrow
against me do they devise my hurt
against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight
all my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
all my springs are in thee
all nations compassed me about
all nations shall call him blessed
all nations shall serve him
all nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name
all sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field,
all that hate me whisper together against me
all that pass by the way spoil him
all that see them shall flee away
all the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name
all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God
all the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the Lord
all the foundations of the earth are out of course
all the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted
all the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O Lord, when they hear the words of thy mouth
all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies
all their thoughts are against me for evil
all they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship
all they that go down to the dust shall bow before him
all they that see me laugh me to scorn
all this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant
all thy commandments are faithful
all thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad
all thy waves and thy billows are gone over me
all thy works shall praise thee, O Lord; and thy saints shall bless thee
also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth
also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy
amen, and Amen
among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither are there any works like unto thy works
an evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him
an horse is a vain thing for safety
and I have walked in thy truth
and I lie even among them that are set on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword
and I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none
and I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest
and I said, This is my infirmity
and I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them that hate him
and I will declare thy greatness
and I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved
and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever
and I will glorify thy name for evermore
and I will have respect unto thy statutes continually
and I will sing praises unto thee among the nations
and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints
and I will walk at liberty
and Og the king of Bashan
and a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked
and all iniquity shall stop her mouth
and all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing
and all that is within me, bless his holy name
and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee
and all the upright in heart shall follow it
and as for his judgments, they have not known them
and as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever
and at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city
and awake for me to the judgment that thou hast commanded
and blessed be his glorious name for ever
and brought out Israel from among them
and by his power he brought in the south wind
and call upon me in the day of trouble
and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant
and darkness was under his feet
and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake
and delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand
and did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the fruit of their ground
and enter not into judgment with thy servant
and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it
and every one of thy righteous judgments endureth for ever
and for cursing and lying which they speak
and forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them
and gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from the west, from the north, and from the south
and gave their land for an heritage
and gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people
and gave them the lands of the heathen
and grant me thy law graciously
and had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven
and had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink
and hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy
and hath redeemed us from our enemies
and he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with gladness
and he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased
and he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever
and he delighteth in his way
and he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that hated them ruled over them
and he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul
and he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God
and he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies
and he is the governor among the nations
and he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to a city of habitation
and he led them on safely, so that they feared not
and he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations
and he remembered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies
and he rode upon a cherub, and did fly
and he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy
and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
and he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noonday
and he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut them off in their own wickedness; yea, the Lord our God shall cut them off
and he shall give thee the desires of thine heart
and he shall hear my voice
and he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness
and he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba
and he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities
and he smote his enemies in the hinder parts
and her saints shall shout aloud for joy
and hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble
and his hands formed the dry land
and his righteousness endureth for ever
and his tender mercies are over all his works
and his years as many generations
and hitherto have I declared thy wondrous works
and if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity
and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory
and in keeping of them there is great reward
and in my name shall his horn be exalted
and in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved
and in the days of famine they shall be satisfied
and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom
and in thy favour our horn shall be exalted
and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple
and in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach thee terrible things
and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted
and let Satan stand at his right hand
and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever
and let all the people say, Amen
and let him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head
and let his prayer become sin
and let me not be ashamed of my hope
and let me not eat of their dainties
and let not any iniquity have dominion over me
and let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified
and let the angel of the Lord chase them
and let the angel of the Lord persecute them
and let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us
and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen
and let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth
and let them not come into thy righteousness
and let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing
and made Israel to pass through the midst of it
and men shall be blessed in him
and men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts
and men will praise thee, when thou doest well to thyself
and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God
and mine eye hath seen his desire upon mine enemies
and my life draweth nigh unto the grave
and my sin is ever before me
and my soul shall be joyful in the Lord
and my spirit made diligent search
and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness
and my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long
and none can keep alive his own soul
and none of the men of might have found their hands
and none of them that trust in him shall be desolate
and nothing shall offend them
and now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me
and now that he lieth he shall rise up no more
and now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee
and of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her
and of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul
and our enemies laugh among themselves
and precious shall their blood be in his sight
and render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord
and see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting
and she that tarried at home divided the spoil
and shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan
and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart
and slew famous kings
and smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of Ham
and so the plague was stayed
and sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruits of increase
and take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments
and that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore
and that which should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap
and the Lord shall help them, and deliver them
and the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the rich among the people shall intreat thy favour
and the fruit of the womb is his reward
and the heavens are the work of thy hands
and the heavens shall declare his righteousness
and the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O Lord
and the highest himself shall establish her
and the land was polluted with blood
and the little hills rejoice on every side
and the meek will he teach his way
and the people which shall be created shall praise the Lord
and the plague brake in upon them
and the terrors of death are fallen upon me
and the truth of the Lord endureth for ever
and the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the branch that thou madest strong for thyself
and the waters covered their enemies
and the wild beasts of the field are mine
and their faces were not ashamed
and their inheritance shall be for ever
and there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare a city for habitation,
and there is no soundness in my flesh
and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof
and there was not one feeble person among their tribes
and they are cut off from thy hand
and they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love
and they inherited the labour of the people,
and they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth
and they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer
and they returned and enquired early after God
and they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the most High?
and they served their idols
and they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness
and they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust
and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied
and they that hate the righteous shall be desolate
and they that hate thee have lifted up the head
and they that know thy name will put their trust in thee
and they that love his name shall dwell therein
and they that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long
and they walked in their own counsels
and they which hate us spoil for themselves
and thou hast delivered my soul from the lowest hell
and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them
and thou renewest the face of the earth
and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life
and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will of his enemies
and thy glory above all the earth,
and thy right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great
and thy truth reacheth unto the clouds
and to him that ordereth his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God
and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn
and unto thee shall the vow be performed
and waters of a full cup are wrung out to them
and who may stand in thy sight when once thou art angry?
and will sing praise to the name of the Lord most high
and wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart
and with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee
and ye fools, when will ye be wise?
and your heart shall live that seek God
are they not in thy book?
arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake
arise, O God, judge the earth
arise, O God, plead thine own cause
arise, O Lord, disappoint him, cast him down
arise, O Lord, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies
arise, O Lord, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength
arise, O Lord; O God, lift up thine hand
arise, O Lord; let not man prevail
arise, O Lord; save me, O my God
as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence
as a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image
as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth
as a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away
as an heavy burden they are too heavy for me
as arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth
as far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us
as for God, his way is perfect
as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them
as for man, his days are as grass
as for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness
as for me, I will call upon God; and the Lord shall save me
as for our transgressions, thou shalt purge them away
as for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity
as for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischief of their own lips cover them
as for the light of mine eyes, it also is gone from me
as for the stork, the fir trees are her house
as for the world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them
as he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones
as he delighted not in blessing, so let it be far from him
as he loved cursing, so let it come unto him
as showers that water the earth
as silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times
as smoke is driven away, so drive them away
as soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me
as the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion
as the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire,
as the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God
as the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the Lord is round about his people from henceforth even for ever
as wax melteth before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God
as we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God
as well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there
as with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
ascribe ye strength unto God
ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession
assur also is joined with them
at midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments
at the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed, hail stones and coals of fire
at thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away
at thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are cast into a dead sleep
attend unto me, and hear me
attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low
awake to help me, and behold
awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp
awake, psaltery and harp
awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for ever
be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, ye righteous
be instructed, ye judges of the earth
be merciful unto me according to thy word
be merciful unto me, O God
be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me
be merciful unto me, O Lord
be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help
be not merciful to any wicked transgressors
be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of his house is increased,
be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart
be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord
be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me
be still, and know that I am God
be surety for thy servant for good
be thankful unto him, and bless his name
be thou exalted, Lord, in thine own strength
be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens
be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth
be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort
be thou my strong rock, for an house of defence to save me
be wise now therefore, O ye kings
be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding
beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl
beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King
because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered my face
because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I call upon him as long as I live
because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him
because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved
because his mercy endureth for ever
because of his strength will I wait upon thee
because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek thy good
because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked
because of thine indignation and thy wrath
because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents unto thee
because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart
because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation
because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God
because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips
because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the most High
because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up
because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice
because thou hast made the Lord, which is my refuge, even the most High, thy habitation,
because thou, Lord, hast holpen me, and comforted me
because thy loving kindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee
because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me
before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength, and come and save us
before I was afflicted I went astray
before the Lord
before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth
before the gods will I sing praise unto thee
before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God
before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath
behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there
behold, God is mine helper
behold, I have longed after thy precepts
behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me
behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine anointed
behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; so our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have mercy upon us
behold, bless ye the Lord, all ye servants of the Lord, which by night stand in the house of the Lord
behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people?
behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep
behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood
behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!
behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the Lord
behold, the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his mercy,
behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they increase in riches
behold, they belch out with their mouth
behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts
behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee
bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar

blessed are they that dwell in thy house
blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart
blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth righteousness at all times
blessed art thou, O Lord
blessed be God
blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his mercy from me
blessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord
blessed be the Lord
blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting
blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting
blessed be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things
blessed be the Lord for evermore
blessed be the Lord my strength which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight
blessed be the Lord out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem
blessed be the Lord, because he hath heard the voice of my supplications
blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even the God of our salvation
blessed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth
blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth and for evermore
blessed is every one that feareth the Lord; that walketh in his ways
blessed is he that considereth the poor
blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered
blessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies
blessed is the man that feareth the Lord, that delighteth greatly in his commandments
blessed is the man that trusteth in him
blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile
blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O Lord, and teachest him out of thy law,
blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts
blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart are the ways of them
blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord; and the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance
blessed is the people that know the joyful sound
bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; but I will trust in thee
blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day
both low and high, rich and poor, together
both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep
both young men, and maidens; old men, and children
bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily
bow down thine ear, O Lord, hear me
bow thy heavens, O Lord, and come down
break out the great teeth of the young lions, O Lord
break their teeth, O God, in their mouth
break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man
bring an offering, and come into his courts
bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name
build thou the walls of Jerusalem
burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required
but God is the judge
but God is the strength of my heart, and my portion for ever
but God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded
but God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses
but God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave
but I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people
but I am like a green olive tree in the house of God
but I am poor and needy
but I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me
but I am poor and sorrowful
but I give myself unto prayer
but I have not forgotten thy law
but I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation
but I hope in thy word
but I trust in the Lord
but I trusted in thee, O Lord
but I will consider thy testimonies
but I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob
but I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and more
but I will keep thy precepts with my whole heart
but I will meditate in thy precepts
but I will remember the years of the right hand of the most High
but I will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes
but I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning
but I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth
but all the wicked will he destroy
but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away
but as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy
but as for me, I will walk in mine integrity
but as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nigh slipped
but as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time
but as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth
but be not thou far from me, O Lord
but chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved
but do thou for me, O God the Lord, for thy name's sake
but he hath not given me over unto death
but he that trusteth in the Lord, mercy shall compass him about
but he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not
but his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate day and night
but in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together
but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them
but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them
but it is good for me to draw near to God
but it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance
but judgment shall return unto righteousness
but know that the Lord hath set apart him that is godly for himself
but let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice
but let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God
but let them not turn again to folly
but lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the desert
but made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock
but mine enemies are lively, and they are strong
but mine eyes are unto thee, O God the Lord
but murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord
but my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him
but my heart standeth in awe of thy word
but my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn
but my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me
but now have I kept thy word
but now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axes and hammers
but our God is in the heavens
but overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea
but peace shall be upon Israel
but the Lord delivereth him out of them all
but the Lord helped me
but the Lord is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge
but the Lord made the heavens
but the Lord shall endure for ever
but the Lord upholdeth the righteous

but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drink them
but the earth hath he given to the children of men
but the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory
but the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace

but there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared
but they devise deceitful matters against them that are quiet in the land
but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing
but those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth
but those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the earth
but thou art he that took me out of the womb
but thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel
but thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end
but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place
but thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with thine anointed
but thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forth with our armies
but thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to shame that hated us
but thou, Lord, art most high for evermore
but thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction
but thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious, longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth
but thou, O Lord, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head
but thou, O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them
but thou, O Lord, how long?
but thou, O Lord, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance unto all generations
but thou, O Lord, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision
but thy commandment is exceeding broad
but thy law do I love
but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favour unto them
but thy servant did meditate in thy statutes
but to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight
but turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers
but unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
but unto thee have I cried, O Lord; and in the morning shall my prayer prevent thee
but upon himself shall his crown flourish
but verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of my prayer
but we are risen, and stand upright
but we will bless the Lord from this time forth and for evermore
but we will remember the name of the Lord our God
but were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works
but when I speak, they are for war
but while their meat was yet in their mouths,
but ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes
by reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my skin
by terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea
by the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, when we remembered Zion
by the word of the Lord were the heavens made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth
by thee have I been holden up from the womb
by them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches
by this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me
cast forth lightning, and scatter them
cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me
cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength faileth
cast thy burden upon the Lord, and he shall sustain thee
cause me to hear thy loving kindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust
cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee
cease from anger, and forsake wrath
clouds and darkness are round about him
coals were kindled by it
come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my soul
come and see the works of God
come before his presence with singing
come, behold the works of the Lord, what desolations he hath made in the earth
come, ye children, hearken unto me
command deliverances for Jacob
commit thy way unto the Lord; trust also in him; and he shall bring it to pass
commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still
concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer
concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever
confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast themselves of idols
consider and hear me, O Lord my God
consider how I love thy precepts
consider mine affliction, and deliver me
consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me with cruel hatred
consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be
corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity
create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me
cut them off in thy truth
day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof
day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth knowledge
deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word
deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes
deceit and guile depart not from her streets
declare among the people his doings
declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all people
deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts
defend me from them that rise up against me
defend the poor and fatherless
delight thyself also in the Lord
deliver me according to thy word
deliver me because of mine enemies
deliver me from all my transgressions
deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation
deliver me from mine enemies, O my God
deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I
deliver me from the hand of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me
deliver me from the oppression of man
deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men
deliver me in thy righteousness
deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape
deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies
deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink
deliver me, O Lord, from mine enemies
deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man
deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man
deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog
deliver my soul from the wicked, which is thy sword
deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips, and from a deceitful tongue
deliver the poor and needy
depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore
depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it
depart from me therefore, ye bloody men
depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping
depart from me, ye evildoers
destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee
destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues
do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion
do good, O Lord, unto those that be good, and to them that are upright in their hearts
do justice to the afflicted and needy
do not I hate them, O Lord, that hate thee? and am not I grieved with those that rise up against thee?
do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the brook of Kison
do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is in their hearts
draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it
draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me
egypt was glad when they departed
enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts with praise
even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel
even an heritage unto Israel his servant
even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me
even unto the Lord, but he answered them not
evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud
every day they wrest my words
every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever
every one of them is gone back
evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him
evil shall slay the wicked
exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy
exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy
examine me, O Lord, and prove me; try my reins and my heart
except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it
except the Lord keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain
extol him that rideth upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him
eyes have they, but they see not
false witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not
fear before him, all the earth
fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in travail
fear was on every side
fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me
feed them also, and lift them up for ever
feet have they, but they walk not
fight against them that fight against me
fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O Lord
fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word
fools because of their transgression, and because of their iniquities, are afflicted
for God hath scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee
for God is in the generation of the righteous
for God is judge himself
for God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth
for God is my defence
for God is my defence, and the God of my mercy
for God is the King of all the earth
for God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah
for I acknowledge my transgressions
for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were
for I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes
for I am poor and needy
for I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me
for I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me
for I am thy servant
for I cry unto thee daily
for I do not forget thy law
for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday
for I have believed thy commandments
for I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping
for I have heard the slander of many
for I have kept the ways of the Lord, and have not wickedly departed from my God
for I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever
for I have seen violence and strife in the city
for I have sought thy precepts
for I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods
for I longed for thy commandments
for I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes
for I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me
for I seek thy precepts
for I shall never be in adversity
for I shall yet praise him for the help of his countenance
for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God
for I trust in thy word
for I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked
for I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin
for I will keep the commandments of my God
for I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me
for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand
for a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night
for all are thy servants
for all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me
for all my ways are before thee
for all our days are passed away in thy wrath
for all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every morning
for all the gods of the nations are idols
for all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works
for all thy commandments are righteousness
for as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him
for by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I leaped over a wall
for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me
for dogs have compassed me
for ever, O Lord, thy word is settled in heaven
for every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a thousand hills
for evildoers shall be cut off
for false witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty
for great is the glory of the Lord
for great is thy mercy toward me
for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the earth
for he commanded, and they were created
for he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves thereof
for he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children
for he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful
for he gave them their own desire,
for he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder
for he hath delivered me out of all trouble
for he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon the floods
for he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth,
for he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard
for he hath shewed me his marvellous kindness in a strong city
for he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee
for he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand
for he is thy Lord; and worship thou him
for he it is that shall tread down our enemies
for he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust
for he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant
for he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again
for he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soul with goodness
for he seeth that his day is coming
for he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others
for he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper
for he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy ways
for he shall receive me
for he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul
for he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast
for he will speak peace unto his people, and to his saints
for his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life
for his merciful kindness is great toward us
for his mercy endureth for ever
for his name alone is excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven
for in death there is no remembrance of thee
for in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same
for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them
for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion
for in thee do I put my trust
for in thee, O Lord, do I hope
for in thy sight shall no man living be justified
for innumerable evils have compassed me about
for it is good to sing praises unto our God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely
for it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it
for man would swallow me up; he fighting daily oppresseth me
for mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for my soul take counsel together,
for mine iniquities are gone over mine head
for my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace be within thee
for my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned as an hearth
for my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing
for my loins are filled with a loathsome disease
for my love they are my adversaries
for my soul is full of troubles
for my soul trusteth in thee
for our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name
for our soul is bowed down to the dust
for praise is comely for the upright
for promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south
for so he giveth his beloved sleep
for strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul
for such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and they that be cursed of him shall be cut off
for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare
for the Lord God is a sun and shield
for the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure
for the Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation
for the Lord heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners
for the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods
for the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations
for the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised
for the Lord is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our king
for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous
for the Lord loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; they are preserved for ever
for the Lord most high is terrible; he is a great King over all the earth
for the Lord preserveth the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer
for the Lord taketh pleasure in his people
for the Lord upholdeth him with his hand
for the Lord will judge his people, and he will repent himself concerning his servants
for the Lord will not cast off his people, neither will he forsake his inheritance
for the arms of the wicked shall be broken
for the dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty
for the end of that man is peace
for the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead
for the fear of them fell upon them
for the king trusteth in the Lord, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved
for the kingdom is the Lord's
for the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me
for the needy shall not alway be forgotten
for the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the Lord; I will set him in safety from him that puffeth at him
for the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever
for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins
for the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright
for the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity
for the shields of the earth belong unto God
for the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride
for the time to favour her, yea, the set time, is come
for the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reason of the enemy and avenger
for the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the Lord abhorreth
for the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall know it no more
for the word of the Lord is right; and all his works are done in truth
for the world is mine, and the fulness thereof
for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me
for their deceit is falsehood
for their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant
for their sakes therefore return thou on high
for there are no bands in their death
for there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the house of David
for there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue
for there is no want to them that fear him
for there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether
for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing us one of the songs of Zion
for there were many with me
for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek my hurt
for they are ever with me
for they are the rejoicing of my heart
for they be many that fight against me, O thou most High
for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me
for they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them
for they have consulted together with one consent
for they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place
for they have made void thy law
for they intended evil against thee
for they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded
for they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images
for they seek not thy statutes
for they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as the green herb
for they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take thy name in vain
for they speak not peace
for they were too strong for me
for thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore
for this God is our God for ever and ever
for this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayest be found
for this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob
for thou art great, and doest wondrous things
for thou art my hope, O Lord God
for thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me
for thou art my strength
for thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness
for thou art the God of my salvation; on thee do I wait all the day
for thou art the God of my strength
for thou art the glory of their strength
for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
for thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it
for thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy
for thou hast been my defence and refuge in the day of my trouble
for thou hast considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities,
for thou hast delivered my soul from death
for thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from tears, and my feet from falling
for thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle
for thou hast heard me from the horns of the unicorns
for thou hast heard me, and art become my salvation
for thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down
for thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour
for thou hast made him most blessed for ever
for thou hast magnified thy word above all thy name
for thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right
for thou hast possessed my reins
for thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly
for thou hast taught me
for thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness
for thou renderest to every man according to his work
for thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands
for thou shalt inherit all nations
for thou shalt judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth
for thou wilt answer me
for thou wilt light my candle
for thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption
for thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down high looks
for thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous in mercy unto all them that call upon thee
for thou, Lord, art high above all the earth
for thou, Lord, hast made me glad through thy work
for thou, Lord, hast not forsaken them that seek thee
for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safety
for thou, Lord, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield
for thou, O God, hast heard my vows
for thou, O God, hast proved us
for thy judgments are good
for thy law is my delight
for thy loving kindness is before mine eyes
for thy mercy is great above the heavens
for thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds
for thy name's sake, O Lord, pardon mine iniquity; for it is great
for thy righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble
for thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine anointed
for thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the dust thereof
for thy testimonies are my meditation
for thy word hath quickened me
for unto thee will I pray
for unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul
for vain is the help of man
for we are brought very low
for we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we troubled
for we are exceedingly filled with contempt
for when he dieth he shall carry nothing away
for who in the heaven can be compared unto the Lord? who among the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the Lord?
for who is God save the Lord? or who is a rock save our God?
for who, say they, doth hear?
for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them
for with the Lord there is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption
for with thee is the fountain of life
for with them thou hast quickened me
for without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul
for yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be
for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities
for, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together
for, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart
for, lo, they lie in wait for my soul
for, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish
for, lo, thine enemies make a tumult
for, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered
forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever
forget not the humble
forget not the voice of thine enemies
forsake me not, O Lord
forsake not the works of thine own hands
forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said, It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known my ways
free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more
fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious against the workers of iniquity
fret not thyself because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man who bringeth wicked devices to pass
fret not thyself in any wise to do evil
from following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance
from him cometh my salvation
from men which are thy hand, O Lord, from men of the world, which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasure
from the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed
from the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the inhabitants of the earth
from the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the Lord's name is to be praised
from the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who compass me about
further not his wicked device; lest they exalt themselves
gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a covenant with me by sacrifice
gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men
gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre,
gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver,
gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver,
gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory and thy majesty
give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication
give ear to my words, O Lord, consider my meditation
give ear, O God of Jacob
give ear, O Lord, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of my supplications
give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth
give ear, O my people, to my law
give me understanding according to thy word
give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart
give me understanding, and I shall live
give me understanding, that I may learn thy commandments
give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son
give them according to their deeds, and according to the wickedness of their endeavours
give them after the work of their hands; render to them their desert
give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name
give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name; worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness
give unto the Lord, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the Lord glory and strength
give unto the Lord, O ye mighty, give unto the Lord glory and strength
give us help from trouble
glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God
glory ye in his holy name
god be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to shine upon us; Selah
god hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth
god hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God
god is a refuge for us
god is gone up with a shout, the Lord with the sound of a trumpet
god is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be had in reverence of all them that are about him
god is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved
god is known in her palaces for a refuge
god is not in all his thoughts
god is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble
god is the Lord, which hath shewed us light
god judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked every day
god looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God
god reigneth over the heathen
god setteth the solitary in families
god shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him
god shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old
god shall help her, and that right early
god shall let me see my desire upon mine enemies
god shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out of the land of the living
god shall send forth his mercy and his truth
god sitteth upon the throne of his holiness
god standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth among the gods
god will establish it for ever
good and upright is the Lord
grace is poured into thy lips
gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful
grant not, O Lord, the desires of the wicked
grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy counsel
great are thy tender mercies, O Lord
great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore
great is our Lord, and of great power
great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in the mountain of his holiness
great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and his greatness is unsearchable
great peace have they which love thy law
great was the company of those that published it
happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the Lord his God
happy is that people, that is in such a case
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them
happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the stones
happy shalt thou be, and it shall be well with thee
harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness
hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah
have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord
have mercy also upon me, and answer me
have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy loving kindness
have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in trouble
have mercy upon me, O Lord; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
have mercy upon me, O Lord; for I am weak
have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us
have respect unto the covenant
have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread
he also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him
he also will hear their cry, and will save them
he appointed the moon for seasons
he asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever
he blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; and suffereth not their cattle to decrease
he bowed the heavens also, and came down
he brake the whole staff of bread
he bringeth out those which are bound with chains
he brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me
he brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings

how say ye to my soul, Flee as a bird to your mountain?
how shall we sing the Lord's song in a strange land?
how sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!

i have trusted also in the Lord; therefore I shall not slide
i have wounded them that they were not able to rise
i hope in thy word
i hoped in thy word

if I ascend up into heaven, thou art there
if I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy
if I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her cunning
if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy)
if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there
if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me
if I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against the generation of thy children
if I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night shall be light about me
if I should count them, they are more in number than the sand
if I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea,
if I were hungry, I would not tell thee
if I would declare and speak of them, they are more than can be numbered
if he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready

if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, now may Israel say,
if it had not been the Lord who was on our side, when men rose up against us
if riches increase, set not your heart upon them
if the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
if they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments,
if thou, Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
if thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore
if we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our hands to a strange god,
in God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me
in God have I put my trust
in God is my salvation and my glory
in God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever

in his hand are the deep places of the earth
in my distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God
in my distress I cried unto the Lord, and he heard me
in the Lord put I my trust
in the Lord will I praise his word
in the congregations will I bless the Lord
in the courts of the Lord's house, in the midst of thee, O Jerusalem
in the day of my trouble I sought the Lord
in the day of my trouble I will call upon thee
in the day when I call answer me speedily
in the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul
in the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire
in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
in the midst of the congregation will I praise thee
in the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth
in the morning they are like grass which groweth up
in the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight my soul
in the net which they hid is their own foot taken
in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock
in the secret places doth he murder the innocent
in the volume of the book it is written of me,
in the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me
in thee is my trust; leave not my soul destitute
in thee, O Lord, do I put my trust
in thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed
in them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
in thy faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness
in thy light shall we see light
in thy name shall they rejoice all the day
in thy presence is fulness of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore
in whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth them that fear the Lord
in whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of bribes
incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness
incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked works with men that work iniquity
incline thine ear unto me, and hear my speech
incline thine ear unto me, and save me
incline thine ear unto my cry,
incline your ears to the words of my mouth
iniquities prevail against me
instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest make princes in all the earth
into that very destruction let him fall
into thine hand I commit my spirit
is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham
it is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me
it is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way perfect
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man
it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes
it is burned with fire, it is cut down
it is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes
it is he that giveth salvation unto kings
it is he that hath made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture
it is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down upon the beard, even Aaron's beard
it is time for thee, Lord, to work
it is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows
it shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithful witness in heaven
it shall rejoice in his salvation

the stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner
the stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep
the strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their close places
the strangers shall submit themselves unto me
the strength of the hills is his also
the sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them down in their dens
the sun knoweth his going down
the sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night
the sun to rule by day
the tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the Hagarenes,
the testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple
the tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working deceitfully
the transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that there is no fear of God before his eyes
the trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted,
the troubles of my heart are enlarged
the tumult of those that rise up against thee increaseth continually
the ungodly are not so
the upright shall dwell in thy presence
the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee

the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands
the wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him with his teeth
the wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God
the wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away
the wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted
the wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him
the wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God
the wild asses quench their thirst
the word of the Lord is tried
the word of the Lord tried him
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit
the words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart
the words of the Lord are pure words
the works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his commandments are sure
the works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein
the world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved
the world also shall be established that it shall not be moved
the wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel
the young lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet
the young lions do lack, and suffer hunger
the young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat from God
their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; and there was none to bury them
their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips
their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand
their eyes stand out with fatness
their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men
their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law
their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands
their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call their lands after their own names
their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings
their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world
their poison is like the poison of a serpent
their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation
their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god
their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near unto the gates of death
their soul is melted because of trouble
their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows shall be broken
then I restored that which I took not away
then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them unto their desired haven
then believed they his words; they sang his praise
then called I upon the name of the Lord; O Lord, I beseech thee, deliver my soul

then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine
then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils
then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth
then the proud waters had gone over our soul
then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over our soul
then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses
then they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saved them out of their distresses
then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth them out of their distresses
then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he saveth them out of their distresses
then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled against us
then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out of the people
then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing
then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy
then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee
then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes
there are the workers of iniquity fallen
there be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us
there brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword, and the battle
there did we rejoice in him
there go the ships
there is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High
there is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali
there is no king saved by the multitude of an host
there is no more any prophet
there is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin
there is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard
there is none that doeth good
there is none that doeth good, no, not one
there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein
there shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon
there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling
there shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god
there was not one of them left
there went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured
there were they in great fear
there were they in great fear, where no fear was
there will I make the horn of David to bud
therefore God hath blessed thee for ever
therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows
therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way
therefore I hate every false way
therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold
therefore I love thy testimonies
therefore doth my soul keep them
therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight
therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help
therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness
therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them
therefore his people return hither
therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate
therefore my heart faileth me
therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him
therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth
therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment
therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me
therefore shall he lift up the head
therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever
therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them
therefore the Lord heard this, and was wroth
therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous
therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble
therefore thy servant loveth it
therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance
therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, among the heathen, and sing praises unto thy name
therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the Lord
therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from the hill Mizar
therefore will he teach sinners in the way
therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea,
these see the works of the Lord, and his wonders in the deep
these things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself
these wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meat in due season
they also do no iniquity
they also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens
they also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is
they also that seek after my life lay snares for me
they angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes
they are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy
they are altogether become filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one
they are brought down and fallen
they are cast down, and shall not be able to rise
they are confederate against thee
they are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression
they are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doeth good
they are fallen under my feet
they are far from thy law
they are full of children, and leave the rest of their substance to their babes
they are inclosed in their own fat
they are like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,
they are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued like other men
they are quenched as the fire of thorns
they became as dung for the earth
they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly
they break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage
they came round about me daily like water; they compassed me about together
they cannot be reckoned up in order unto thee
they commune of laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
they compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause
they compassed me about like bees
they compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about
they continue this day according to thine ordinances
they cried unto thee, and were delivered
they cried, but there was none to save them
they delight in lies
they did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them
they draw nigh that follow after mischief
they drop upon the pastures of the wilderness
they encourage themselves in an evil matter
they envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord
they forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in Egypt,
they gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion
they gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous, and condemn the innocent blood
they gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul
they gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink
they give drink to every beast of the field
they go astray as soon as they be born, speaking lies
they go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion appeareth before God
they go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them

they have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land
they have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground
they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they are fallen themselves
they have ears, but they hear not
they have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths
they have hands, but they handle not
they have holpen the children of Lot
they have more than heart could wish
they have mouths, but they speak not
they have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they see not,
they have not called upon God
they have not set God before them
they have now compassed us in our steps
they have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down
they have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance
they have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, my King, in the sanctuary
they have set their eyes bowing down to the earth,
they have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poison is under their lips
they have spoken against me with a lying tongue
they have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consulted against thy hidden ones
they imagined a mischievous device, which they are not able to perform
they joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead
they kept his testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them
they kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law,
they know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness
they look and stare upon me
they looked unto him, and were lightened
they made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image
they made long their furrows
they make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city
they mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths
they only consult to cast him down from his excellency
they part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture
they perish at the rebuke of thy countenance
they persecute me wrongfully; help thou me
they pierced my hands and my feet
they prevented me in the day of my calamity
they reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their wit's end
they remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy
they return at evening
they rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul
they run and prepare themselves without my fault
they said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together
they saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and hasted away
they search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search
they set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue walketh through the earth
they shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness
they shall be a portion for foxes
they shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures
they shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
they shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this
they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away
they shall enter into the king's palace
they shall fall by the sword
they shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations
they shall not be ashamed in the evil time
they shall not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate
they shall perish, but thou shalt endure
they shall praise the Lord that seek him
they shall prosper that love thee
they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy power,
they shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing,
they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance
they shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham
they shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying,
they slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless
they soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel
they speak loftily
they speak vanity every one with his neighbour
they stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and uprightness
they that did see me without fled from me
they that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust
they that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word
they that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in great waters,
they that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of mine head
they that make them are like unto them
they that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them
they that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song of the drunkards
they that sow in tears shall reap in joy
they that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abideth for ever
they that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multitude of their riches,
they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, are mighty
they trusted in thee, and were not confounded
they trusted, and thou didst deliver them
they walk in his ways
they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found no city to dwell in
they went through the flood on foot
they were not estranged from their lust
they were turned aside like a deceitful bow
they will be still praising thee
thine arrows also went abroad
thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies; whereby the people fall under thee
thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set up their ensigns for signs
thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in thy book all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them
thine hand shall find out all thine enemies
this I had, because I kept thy precepts
this I know; for God is for me
this also shall please the Lord better than an ox or bullock that hath horns and hoofs
this gate of the Lord, into which the righteous shall enter
this he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt
this honour have all his saints
this is my comfort in my affliction
this is my rest for ever
this is the Lord's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes
this is the day which the Lord hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it
this is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face, O Jacob
this poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles

this shall be written for the generation to come
this their way is their folly
this thou hast seen, O Lord
those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God

thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known
thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary
thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house
thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee
thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path
thy word is true from the beginning
thy word is very pure
thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves
thy years are throughout all generations
to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity
to bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom
to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron,
to day if ye will hear his voice,
to declare the name of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem,
to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine
to execute upon them the judgment written
to execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon the people,
to hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are appointed to death,
to him that by wisdom made the heavens
to him that made great lights
to him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice
to him that smote Egypt in their firstborn
to him that stretched out the earth above the waters
to him which divided the Red sea into parts
to him which led his people through the wilderness
to him which smote great kings
to him who alone doeth great wonders
to judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress
to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the glorious majesty of his kingdom
to overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands
to see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary
to shew forth thy loving kindness in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night,
to shew that the Lord is upright
to such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them
to the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent
touch the mountains, and they shall smoke
tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
trouble and anguish have taken hold on me
truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean heart
truly my soul waiteth upon God
trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him
trust in the Lord, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily thou shalt be fed
trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery
truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall look down from heaven
try me, and know my thoughts
turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams in the south
turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way
turn away my reproach which I fear
turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate and afflicted
turn unto me according to the multitude of thy tender mercies
turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved
turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved
turn us again, O Lord God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; and we shall be saved
turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward us to cease
under his tongue is mischief and vanity
understand, ye brutish among the people
unite my heart to fear thy name
unless the Lord had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in silence
unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction
until I find out a place for the Lord, an habitation for the mighty God of Jacob
until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end
until the time that his word came
unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness
unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the heavens
unto thee will I cry, O Lord my rock; be not silent to me
unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel
unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks
unto thee, O Lord, do I lift up my soul
unto thee, O Lord, will I sing
unto thee, O my strength, will I sing
unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into my rest
uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live
upon a psaltery and an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee
upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon the harp with a solemn sound
upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest
upon thy right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir
verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands in innocency
verily every man at his best state is altogether vanity
verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth
vow, and pay unto the Lord your God
wait on the Lord
wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land
wait, I say, on the Lord
walk about Zion, and go round about her
wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin
wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow
we are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derision to them that are round about us
we bless you in the name of the Lord
we found it in the fields of the wood
we hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof
we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord
we have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old
we have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly
we have thought of thy loving kindness, O God, in the midst of thy temple
we see not our signs
we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple
we spend our years as a tale that is told
we took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company
we will go into his tabernacles
we will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done
we will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners
we will shew forth thy praise to all generations
we will worship at his footstool
wealth and riches shall be in his house
weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning
what ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan, that thou wast driven back?
what can man do unto me?
what is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
what man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that he may see good?
what man is he that feareth the Lord? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose
what man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah
what profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit? Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits toward me?
what shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee, thou false tongue?
what time I am afraid, I will trust in thee
whatsoever the Lord pleased, that did he in heaven, and in earth, in the seas, and all deep places
when God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth
when God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel
when I awake, I am still with thee
when I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained,
when I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back
when I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long
when I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches
when I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me
when I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O Lord, held me up
when I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly
when I thought to know this, it was too painful for me,
when I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to my reproach
when Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a people of strange language,
when he bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces
when he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them
when he shall be judged, let him be condemned
when he slew them, then they sought him
when mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence
when my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me up
when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me
when my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path
when shall I come and appear before God?
when the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow in Salmon
when the Lord shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his glory
when the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like them that dream
when the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to serve the Lord
when the waves thereof arise, thou stillest them
when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it
when the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever
when the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell
when their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall hear my words; for they are sweet
when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice
when they looked upon me they shaked their heads
when they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people,
when they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it
when thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thy face, Lord, will I seek
when thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and hast been partaker with adulterers
when thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth
when your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work
where I heard a language that I understood not
where the birds make their nests
wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it
wherefore hast thou made all men in vain?
wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction and our oppression?
wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity of my heels shall compass me about?
wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed
wherein all the beasts of the forest do creep forth
wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom
wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O Lord; wherewith they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed
wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word
which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power
which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac,
which executeth judgment for the oppressed
which giveth food to the hungry
which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved
which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they gathered together for war
which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race
which keepeth truth for ever
which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is
which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I was in trouble
which perished at Endor
which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people
which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a fountain of waters
which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us
which were a snare unto them
which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely
while I live will I praise the Lord
while I suffer thy terrors I am distracted
while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my life
whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the Lord, unto the testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the Lord
who can stand before his cold?
who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret faults
who can utter the mighty acts of the Lord? who can shew forth all his praise?
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment
who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains
who delivereth David his servant from the hurtful sword
who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy diseases,
who giveth food to all flesh
who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are our own
who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven, and in the earth!
who is like unto the Lord our God, who dwelleth on high,
who is lord over us?
who is so great a God as our God?
who is this King of glory? The Lord of hosts, he is the King of glory
who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle
who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy fear, so is thy wrath
who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever
who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters
who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire
who maketh the clouds his chariot
who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rain also filleth the pools
who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies,
who remembered us in our low estate
who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in possession
who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle's
who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants
who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or who shall stand in his holy place?
who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings,
who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast
who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain
who walketh upon the wings of the wind
who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words
who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?
whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth that I desire beside thee
whose feet they hurt with fetters
whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lest they come near unto thee
whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord
whoso offereth praise glorifieth me
whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off
why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God
why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope in God
why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God
why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodness of God endureth continually
why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
why dost thou cast me off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her?
why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desireth to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever
why standest thou afar off, O Lord? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it out of thy bosom
wickedness is in the midst thereof
will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
wilt not thou deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light of the living?
wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, which didst not go out with our armies?
wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou, O God, go forth with our hosts?
wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine anger to all generations?
wilt thou not revive us again
wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee? Selah
with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm
with flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak
with gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought
with hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth
with long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation
with my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth
with my mouth will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations
with my whole heart have I sought thee
with righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity
with the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright,
with the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the froward thou wilt shew thyself froward
with their mouth they speak proudly
with trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the Lord, the King
with whom my hand shall be established
withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord
woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents of Kedar!
wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the Red sea
worship him, all ye gods
ye are blessed of the Lord which made heaven and earth
ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his refuge
ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills, like lambs?
ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord
ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel
ye that fear the Lord, trust in the Lord
ye that love the Lord, hate evil
ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God
yea, I sought him, but he could not be found
yea, all kings shall fall down before him
yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed
yea, all their princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna
yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are counted as sheep for the slaughter
yea, happy is that people, whose God is the Lord
yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind
yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,
yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them
yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth
yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make my refuge, until these calamities be overpast
yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed
yea, let them exceedingly rejoice
yea, let them say continually, Let the Lord be magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant
yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath
yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me
yea, the Lord shall give that which is good; and our land shall yield her increase
yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not
yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth as the day
yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God
yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word
yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it
yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto devils,
yea, they shall sing in the ways of the Lord
yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?
yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel
yea, thou liftest me up above those that rise up against me
yea, thou shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be
yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel
yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil
yea, thy law is within my heart
yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God
yet I erred not from thy precepts
yet do I not forget thy law
yet do not I forget thy precepts
yet have I not declined from thy law
yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion
yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not
yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh him families like a flock
yet the Lord will command his loving kindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life
yet their posterity approve their sayings
yet they have not prevailed against me
yet they say, The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard it
yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies
yet thy commandments are my delights
your heart shall live for ever
zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced because of thy judgments, O Lord
