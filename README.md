About
--------
**The Book of Eliza** is an entry for NaNoGenMo 2015.  It is an irreverent retelling of the story of Exodus.  In the novel, Moses leads the Israelites into the desert, and promptly gets lost.  The generator simulates their movement through the desert, until by chance they pass Mt. Sinai and later arrive in Jerusalem.

Output is formatted similar to a Biblical book, with chapter and verse notes.

In addition to the travel journal, there are chapters of random praise created by Markov chain seeded with the Book of Psalms.

There is also an output [.kml file](./novel.kml) that tracks the movements of the group, and can be used for debugging or reference.
