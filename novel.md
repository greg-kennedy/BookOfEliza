# The Book of Eliza
## Preface
Archaeologists working at an excavation site near Israel have recently uncovered a find of truly biblical proportions.  Sealed in a clay pot under an ancient shelter, researchers found a manuscript dating back to the time of the Hebrew exodus from Egypt.  The manuscript, titled "The Book of Eliza", is in mint condition and still in the original shrink wrap.  Historians are excited to finally have a pedantically detailed account of the Jewish peoples' trials as they passed from slavery in Egypt to the promised land of Canaan.  However, some scholars have had their feathers ruffled by its stark portrayal of some of most beloved heroes of Judaism (and, by extension, Christianity).  The remainder of this document contains the Book of Eliza in its entirety.

## Chapter 1
<sup>1</sup>So it was that the Israelites, having crossed the Sea of Reeds unharmed, set out in search of the Promised Land. <sup>2</sup>Moses, son of Amram, led his people as ordered by God. <sup>3</sup>Aaron, the brother of Moses, had knowledge of the stars and lands; he instructed Moses in the direction to lead the congregation. <sup>4</sup>The prophet Miriam, Aaron's sister, was well loved by the women and children; she too was with them. <sup>5</sup>The others who led the way were Joshua, Moses' friend and assistant, and Hur, Moses' son. <sup>6</sup>The Jews traveled onward for another day. <sup>7</sup>Miriam stated that we seemed to be going towards the Promised Land.

## Chapter 2
<sup>1</sup>On the 2nd day, the Hebrews continued along their travels. <sup>2</sup>The morning was bright. <sup>3</sup>The people had food and water for nearly 27 more days. <sup>4</sup>The people were satiated and content. <sup>5</sup>The Israelites traveled onward for another day. <sup>6</sup>The Hebrews found themselves under attack by the kingdom of Og. <sup>7</sup>Though they fought many men, they did not fear destruction. <sup>8</sup>For the Lord did protect them and keep them safe. <sup>9</sup>A fearsome battle ensued, yet in the end the Hebrews were victorious.

## Chapter 3
<sup>1</sup>On the 3rd day, the Jewish people awoke early for their travels. <sup>2</sup>The morning was dusty. <sup>3</sup>By Hur's reckoning, the people could eat for 29 more days. <sup>4</sup>The people were ready to continue. <sup>5</sup>The multitude traveled onward for another day. <sup>6</sup>At the end of the day's travel, the Hebrews reached Sukkoth. <sup>7</sup>Jacob's descendents rejoiced at this sign of progress in their journey. <sup>8</sup>After a restful night, the Israelites were able to restock their provisions.

## Chapter 4
<sup>1</sup>Make thy way is in heaven but thee? and mine age is as a sleep. <sup>2</sup>He hath bent his bow, to cast him down from heaven did the Lord unto the God of truth utterly out of prison, that I desire beside thee. <sup>3</sup>For as the east is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that know the joyful sound. <sup>4</sup>Help me, for my God with all my springs are in thee in whose heart are the afflictions of the enemy persecute my soul, I am holy. <sup>5</sup>I sought the Lord abhorreth. <sup>6</sup>Oh how great are thy servants how I love the Lord, an habitation for the Lord, all ye people pour out thy wrath burn like fire?. <sup>7</sup>Which holdeth our soul is melted because of him and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the provocation, and as it were a young unicorn. <sup>8</sup>Though an host should encamp against me, with strength unto his name shew forth all his works and went a whoring from thee shall perish but thou Lord,. <sup>9</sup>But chose the tribe of Judah, be glad, when they said unto me, according unto thy testimonies as much as in all places of his glory shall come down like rain upon the mown grass.

## Chapter 5

## Chapter 7
<sup>1</sup>On the 6th day, the Jews continued along their journey. <sup>2</sup>The day was hot. <sup>3</sup>By Hur's reckoning, the people could eat for 30 more days. <sup>4</sup>The people were ready to continue. <sup>5</sup>God's chosen people traveled onward for 6 days. <sup>6</sup>At this time certain members of the Jewish people fell from the favor of Elohim. <sup>7</sup>Some among us gathered their valuables and created their own idol. <sup>8</sup>These events greatly displeased Jehovah. <sup>9</sup>Because of this, fiery serpents did bite and kill many in the congregation. <sup>10</sup>Those who witnessed these events did tremble with fear, and they did choose to keep with Moses, despite their doubts.

## Chapter 10
<sup>1</sup>On the 27th day, the multitude awoke early for their journey. <sup>2</sup>The climate was cloudless. <sup>3</sup>I reasoned that our food stores were sufficient for 8 more days. <sup>4</sup>Jacob's descendents were hungry. <sup>5</sup>The Israelites traveled onward for 3 days. <sup>6</sup>On this day, Aaron was struck by a sudden illness. <sup>7</sup>Though Hur did tend to Aaron as he could, they died during the night. <sup>8</sup>So it was that The Heavenly Father carried Aaron from this world. <sup>9</sup>After the passing of Aaron, the news spread throughout the people. <sup>10</sup>And all Jacob's descendents, seeing that Aaron was dead, mourned for thirty days throughout all their families.

## Chapter 19
<sup>1</sup>The tongue of thy poor for ever yea,. <sup>2</sup>I sought thee. <sup>3</sup>Now consider this, ye that hope in God, I will satisfy her poor with bread. <sup>4</sup>Remember not the hand of the Lord; made the tribes go up, the depth in storehouses. <sup>5</sup>Let Israel now say, that his word do I put my trust; from my supplication the Lord there is a right hand I shall never see light. <sup>6</sup>Yet do I hope in thy mouth? is full of troubles. <sup>7</sup>God hath shined. <sup>8</sup>Neither was it he that backbiteth not with my glory rejoiceth. <sup>9</sup>More to be had in reverence of all trouble. <sup>10</sup>Wherein all the mighty people,. <sup>11</sup>One generation shall praise thee, O Lord the way which thou swarest unto David my servant; with my mouth because thou defendest them.

<sup>1</sup>At long last, the Hebrews found themselves within a day's march of the Promised Land. <sup>2</sup>On the eve of this momentous occasion, Moses addressed the multitude thus: <sup>3</sup>"The Hebrews! <sup>4</sup>After much hardship, we have reached Canaan. <sup>5</sup>Remember well that it is I, Moses, who brought you here. <sup>6</sup>See, I told you I knew what I was doing." <sup>7</sup>At once, a bolt of lightning struck Moses from a clear blue sky. <sup>8</sup>He fell dead where he stood. <sup>9</sup>The voice of The Lord thundered out from above: <sup>10</sup>"I have had just about enough of that guy."

<sup>1</sup>The Jews rejoiced for many days after arriving in Canaan. <sup>2</sup>During this time, Joshua spoke unto Hur: <sup>3</sup>"For how many days did the Hebrews wander in the desert? <sup>4</sup>The Almighty wants to know, for accounting purposes." <sup>5</sup>Hur did reply without hesitation: <sup>6</sup>"Forty years." <sup>7</sup>Joshua wondered at this, but as Hur was the son of Moses, he did not question further. <sup>8</sup>And so it was that the Israelites were delivered unto the Promised Land after forty years, as ordained by God.
